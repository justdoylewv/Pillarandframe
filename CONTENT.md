# Pillar & Frame content handoff

The site remains an owner-private review. Do not change its audience without Doyle's instruction.

## Plugging in content

Edit `dist/content.js`. No page markup changes are required for these slots:
- `bookingUrl`: approved HTTPS scheduling link. All booking CTAs use it. While empty, the CTA opens an honest booking-coming-soon message.
- `reel`: the full-width hero reel.
- `samples`: nine named slots: sales-1 through sales-3, stakeholders-1 through stakeholders-3, hiring-1 through hiring-3.
- `quotes`: three objects with quote, name, title, and company. Only approved quotes with a name replace the placeholders.

For a media item:
- `kind: "video"`: set `src` to a local MP4 path such as `/media/project-story.mp4` or an HTTPS media URL. Set `poster` to an approved still and `captions` to an English WebVTT file. Native controls include play/pause, seeking, volume and fullscreen. Mobile inline playback, no autoplay, preload none.
- `kind: "embed"`: set `src` to the actual player embed URL from Wistia, Vimeo, or YouTube. Supported hosts: fast.wistia.net, fast.wistia.com, player.vimeo.com, www.youtube-nocookie.com, www.youtube.com, and any *.cloudflarestream.com customer subdomain. Provider controls and captions are configured in the provider. Use an embed URL, not a sharing page URL or pasted HTML.
- `title`: accessible player title.
- `caption`: project name and client shown beneath a sample. Label reused projects honestly; do not imply a different project or outcome.

Empty sources show labeled placeholders; no client footage, quotes, results or logos have been fabricated. The previous AI illustration is retained as an unused asset and is not presented as project evidence. No Testimonial Hero footage, brand assets, or third-party players are embedded.

Testimonial Hero reference inspection: full-width Wistia brand film and groups of three Wistia samples (via Embedly), with poster images and play buttons. This page uses the presentation pattern with original design and configurable first-party content.

## Doyle's confirmation notes — not website copy

- Three genuine client quotes; PowerField is pending. One real quote is preferable to three placeholders.
- The PowerField result is missing. Do not invent a number.
- Validate half-day coverage in October before a public launch: client interview, crew interview and b-roll.
- Confirm $4,500 / $5,500 / $7,500 tier pricing. Approximately $2,000 delivery cost is an internal estimate; cold-buyer pricing remains untested.
- Fill all nine sample slots. Reusing PowerField is acceptable with honest labels.
- Confirm the supplied fourteen-day guarantee and approval timing before public launch.
- Booking URL supplied and connected to all booking CTAs: https://api.leadconnectorhq.com/widget/booking/ihHVVEe4Cdt6qncNDcpU

The supplied marketing claims, capacity, deadlines, prices and guarantees are reproduced as requested; they have not been independently substantiated.

## Page editing

`build-page.py` contains the supplied page copy and generates `dist/index.html`. It preserves an existing `dist/content.js`. Styling is in `dist/style.css`; runtime media/booking replacement is in `dist/media.js`.

## Hero film

The PowerField Energy Overview film is hosted on Cloudflare Stream, video id `48541099eb193915f4f9346d4d141e58`, and plays in Stream's own player through an iframe embed. The MP4 is no longer in this repository. Manifests, should a native player ever be wanted: HLS `https://customer-s1p4vr78n6e8vtaw.cloudflarestream.com/48541099eb193915f4f9346d4d141e58/manifest/video.m3u8`, DASH `https://customer-s1p4vr78n6e8vtaw.cloudflarestream.com/48541099eb193915f4f9346d4d141e58/manifest/video.mpd`.

`build-page.py` writes the iframe into the static page, so the film plays without JavaScript, and emits VideoObject metadata with the title, description, duration, Stream thumbnail, embed URL, and the HLS manifest as the content URL. No release date or transcript has been invented; add `uploadDate` and a captions track when they exist.

If the video is set to require signed URLs in the Cloudflare dashboard, the public iframe stops working. Leave it on public playback.
